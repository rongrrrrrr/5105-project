The total reported here includesnon-primary travel vendor data emissions, which were based on our 2021 third-party spend data and an Economic Input-Output Model performed by Climate Earth, Inc.1 Based on third-party spend data and an Economic Input-Output Model performed by Climate Earth, Inc.2 Values are adjusted to reflect the effects of the Organon spin-off on our emissions.3 Emission factors from Argonne National Laboratory's GREET Model (https://greet.es.anl.gov/) were used in conjunction with primary fuel and energy-use data.4 Primary-waste data were used with the U.S. EPA's WARM Model (https://www.epa.gov/warm).5 Including recycled and composted waste in these calculations would result in negative emissions in 2017 (-41,200 MT CO₂e), 2018 (-43,700 MT CO₂e), 2019 (-62,400 MT CO₂e), 2020(-48,900 MT CO₂e) and 2021 (-46,300 MT CO₂e).6 Based on primary travel vendor data, employee-reimbursable mileage and UK Defra factors.7 Emissions are based on primary vendor data where available and economic input-output modeling performed by Climate Earth, Inc., using spend data.8 2020 and 2021 reductions caused by shifts to remote working due to the COVID-19 pandemic.9 Emissions were calculated using our \"Upstream transportation and distribution\" spend data as a worst-case estimate entered into the WRI Quantis tool. We assumed that all \"downstream\"material would first have been stored, transported and handled \"upstream.\"10 Due to recent acquisitions, we are currently evaluating the applicability of additional products to this category. This category currently includes the impacts of our Animal Health productsENGEMYCIN (oxytetracycline), NEO SPRAY CAF (oxytetracyclinum), OXYTETRIN LA (oxytetracycline) only.11 Calculated assuming that all primary, secondary and tertiary packaging purchased was disposed of by our customers. Packaging material data was used with the U.S. EPA's WARM Model.12 May not add up to total due to rounding.Merck ESG Progress Report 2021/2022Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices107"
