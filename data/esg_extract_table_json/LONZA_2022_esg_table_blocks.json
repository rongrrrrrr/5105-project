Local management is responsible for\nmaintaining good labor relations according to legal\nrequirements and agreements with unions, work\ncouncils and other employee- representing bodies.\nWe respect these relationships and work with these\nparties in a mutually respectful manner. In addition\nto the country-specific employee representation, we\nhave also established a European Work Council that\nholds regular meetings. This is designed to maintain\na positive flow of information and communication. In\nthe European Works Council, all European countries\nwith more than 100 employees are represented by\nemployee- nominated delegates: Belgium, France,\nGermany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and\nthe United Kingdom. The European Work Council is\nassisted and supported by a union secretary."
