We do not track union membership or discriminate against employees\nwith memberships.\nAround 12% of our total global workforce is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In addition, many employees are based in\nlocations with national or industry labor contract frameworks, which typically define minimum wage and wage increases, and give\nguidance for the formation of works councils. We actively partner with works councils on the development and deployment of global and\nlocal employment policies.\nAlongside country-specific employee representation, we have established a European Works Council (EWC) that holds regular meetings.\nThe EWC’s 2023 annual meeting took place in person with senior Lonza leaders including members of the EC. It included an update on\nLonza’s business and people strategy. Ad hoc sessions with local representatives took place during the year to update Council members\non people-related topics."
