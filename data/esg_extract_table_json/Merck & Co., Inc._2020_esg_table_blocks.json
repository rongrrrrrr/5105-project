    "content": "I’m committed to accelerating Merck’s success in cultivating a diverse and inclusive workforce\nand a culture that inspires creativity and promotes health and wellbeing. Today, 46 percent of our\ncompany’s board of directors are women and 23 percent are from underrepresented groups. We have\nalso come a long way with our workforce, and are confident that our momentum will allow us\nto achieve our new Global Diversity & Inclusion goals—with a special focus on senior leadership roles.\nWe’ve taken big steps to accelerate the impact of our environmental sustainability agenda as well.\nBy 2025, our goal is to achieve carbon neutrality across our operations—for our Scope 1 and 2\nemissions (the fossil fuels we burn on site and the electricity we purchase). We will also accelerate\nby 15 years our previous 2040 goal to source 100 percent renewable energy for purchased electricity.\nIn addition, we are committed to reducing our Scope 3 value chain emissions 30 percent by 2030,\nby continuing to engage with suppliers to help reduce their emissions.\nThese and other examples of our ESG progress are detailed in this report, which uses widely\nrecognized reporting frameworks. Our goals are informed by our ESG materiality assessment,\nas well as input from stakeholders, and can be found on page 9 of the report. The report also reflects\nour support for the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact and recognizes the important\nrole we play in helping to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nWe have prioritized eight SDGs where we are positioned to have the most significant impact.\nOf these, our primary focus is SDG 3, Good Health and Well-being, which aligns with our core\nbusiness. This involves helping to ensure our science advances health care and our products\nare accessible and affordable to those in need, and while doing so, minimizing our impact on\nthe environment, promoting inclusive economic growth, and establishing partnerships to achieve\nour goals.\nAs I assume responsibility for ensuring our ongoing success as a socially responsible company,\nI am grateful for the extraordinary vision of Ken Frazier, our executive chairman and former CEO.\nHis commitment to investing in discovery and translational research as the source of our long-term\nbusiness success, and the social value we contribute to our patients and customers, has never\nwavered. His leadership and values are reflected in the ingenuity, resilience and perseverance\nthat our employees have shown throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and permeate every\naspect of our company.\nI am proud of what the people of Merck have achieved this year and I am excited about the\nopportunity to build on our innovation, science and extraordinary talent to realize a better\nfuture for generations to come.\nSincerely,\nRobert M. Davis\nChief Executive Officer and President\t\" I am proud of what the people of\nMerck have achieved this year and I\nam excited about the opportunity to\nbuild on our innovation, science and\nextraordinary talent to realize a better\nfuture for generations to come.\""
