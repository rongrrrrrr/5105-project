Those risks are then ranked by criticality (a combination of\nprobability and impact), and by level of control. The formal output generated by this process is a risk profile,\nupdated annually by our risk management team;\n- emerging risks that may constitute opportunities and/or threats over the next ten years:\nThe identification process is the same as for risks. Emerging risks are classified into the disruption categories\nhighlighted in the World Economic Forum report; they are evaluated and ranked based on their probability,\nimpact, and velocity (i.e. how quickly they could become a risk for Sanofi). The formal output generated by\nthis process is an emerging risks scan. In 2022, the Executive Committee and the Risk Committee approved\nthe inclusion of climate risks in the company risk matrix. The “Climate Transition and Physical Impact” risk,\npreviously identified as emerging, is now managed as an active risk. It includes the following sub-topics:\nCarbon Costs, Raw Material Scarcity, Water Stress, Stakeholder Pressure, Logistics Disruption, Natural\nDisasters, Energy Efficiency, and Eco-Design. It is fully embedded into our Risk Management governance\nand processes, and is reviewed at least on a yearly basis.\nAmong the emerging risks identified, “Adapt our business to climate transition” includes the Health\nResilience and Health Systems Disruption sub-topics, both of which may require our business model to\nevolve over the long term in anticipation of climate change impacts.\nOur processes for managing climate-related risks\nLine managers are designated to manage each of the risks evidenced in our risk profile. They are tasked with\npreparing, implementing and monitoring delivery of adaptation plans. This process applies to climate-related\nrisks.\nMost of the sub-topics included in the “Climate transition and physical impact” risk are monitored in dedicated\nworking groups. Short, medium and long-term mitigation plans have been defined and have started to be\nimplemented. Monthly reporting is escalated to the Climate Risk and Opportunities Committee (CROC) and\nprogress is presented quarterly to the Executive Committee Climate Risk Owner by the Global Heads of Risk\nManagement, CSR and the CROC leader.\nThrough 2023, Sanofi has developed and started implementing adaptation plans for the sub-topics within the\nClimate Transition and Physical Impact category. These adaptation plans will continue to be implemented,\nmonitored and adjusted as appropriate throughout 2024 and beyond.\nBecause emerging risks are not yet active risks, our Risk Management department works with in-house\nexperts to develop scenarios to show how these could turn into active risks, identifying the tipping points and\nearly warning signs to look out for.\nHow processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into our overall\n\trisk management:\nClimate-related risks and emerging risks are subject to the same governance as the overall Sanofi risk\nmanagement process.\nOur risk profile and emerging risks scan, and scenarios for a selection of emerging risks, are presented annually\nto the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors.\nThe Executive Committee monitors risk mitigation and obtains assurance that adequate resources are\nallocated to it, and decides what anticipatory action should be taken to seize opportunities and protect Sanofi\nfrom threats arising from emerging risks.\nc) Describe how processes for CDP C2.2\nidentifying, assessing and\nmanaging climate-related risks are\nintegrated into the organization’s\noverall risk management"
