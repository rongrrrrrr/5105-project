Then, in 2021,\na cross-functional team of associates and leadership from\nacross the business came together to develop and launch an\nimproved scorecard that is fully embedded into our enterprise\nstage-gate process. This scorecard evaluates new and existing\nproducts against sustainability KPIs, such as water and energy\nuse, GHG emissions and waste generated. It allows us to\ndetermine the sustainability impact of products long before\nproduction and make improvements before launch.\nIn 2022, we aim to implement the scorecard across all early-\nstage R&D projects.\nMessage From Our CEO About Alcon Serving Communitie\n2021 Corporate Responsibility Report\t\tntifying opportunities at\nironmental impact of o\nCHIE\t\n\tMessage From Our CEO About Alcon Serving Communitie\n2021 Corporate Responsibility Report\tCaring for Our Protecting\ns\nCustomers and Patients Environme\tOur\nSupporting People Working With Integrity ESG Performance Data ESG Reporting Frameworks Index 27\nnt"
