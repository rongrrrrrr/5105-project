Our 2020/2021 Environmental,\nSocial and Governance (ESG) Progress Report reflects our commitment to sustaining this\nlegacy. Through scientific breakthroughs, inclusive clinical development strategies, and\nenvironmentally responsible manufacturing, our products are increasingly accessible and\naffordable to those in need around the world.\nAs we face the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its devastating impact on\nglobal health and economies, I am deeply grateful to the employees across our entire\ncompany. Because of their dedication and resilience, discovery research is flourishing in our\nRobert M. Davis new research hubs, and patients and customers around the world can be confident in the\nChief Executive Officer and President continued quality and reliable supply of our products.\nIn addition, our scientists are advancing an antiviral candidate, molnupiravir, in collaboration\nwith Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, for people with early COVID-19 infection outside of\nhospital settings. We have already granted voluntary licenses to a number of established\nIndian generic manufacturers to accelerate the availability of molnupiravir in India and in\nother low- and middle-income countries, contingent upon authorization by local regulatory\nagencies. We are also collaborating with Johnson & Johnson to scale up production of its\npandemic vaccine to help expand global access.\nOur ESG efforts are grounded in the core values that have always guided our mission:\nresponsibility to patients and animals who need our medicines and vaccines; respect,\ninclusion and accountability to our employees; sustaining the highest standards of ethics\nand integrity; and innovation and scientific excellence.\nI am especially proud of our long-standing commitment to helping solve the world’s most\nvexing health challenges. In 2020, our products and pipeline targeted 88 percent of the top\n20 global burdens of disease. We also expanded patient access to these essential therapies\nand are working to improve health equity for more people in low- and middle-income\ncountries and in underserved people in the United States, through our social investments.\nFor example, we are celebrating the 10th year anniversary of Merck for Mothers, our $500\nmillion investment in innovative programming that is helping to eliminate preventable\ncauses of maternal mortality.\nVisit our corporate website\nto learn more about our\nCOVID-19\nrelated actions\nMerck ESG Progress Report 2020/2021 Overview GRI/SASB: General disclosures Economic Environmental Social Indices 3"
