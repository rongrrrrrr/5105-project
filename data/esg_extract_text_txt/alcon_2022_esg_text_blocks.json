Brilliance is a quality of sight, but it also\ndescribes how we imagine and deliver this essential health outcome. This principle guides the way we work in the communities we serve and how we\ninteract with each other, our collaborators and our customers, as well as our efforts to be a responsible steward of natural resources.\nIn that light, I am proud to share our 2022 Social Impact and Sustainability Report. In the following pages, you’ll see a detailed catalog of performance\nand projects from the past year, addressing important social, environmental and governance topics. Enabling our progress is a system of values and\nshared cultural priorities that empower everyone at Alcon to make a Brilliant Impact.\nThroughout 2022, we strengthened the three pillars of our work that also describe our overarching objectives as a company: Brilliant Lives, Brilliant\nInnovation and Brilliant Planet. Allow me to share a few examples.\nBRILLIANT LIVES\nWe are committed to reducing the toll that low vision and preventable vision loss take around the world. To accomplish this, we provide direct access\nto eye care for under-resourced populations and work to increase the local capacity to diagnose vision problems and deliver care. With an emphasis on\ntraining and education, through our Phaco Development program we trained 580 doctors who performed 1.6 million procedures around the world. The\nAlcon Cares program provided $25 million in product and equipment donations, and our Alcon Foundation donated $4 million to nonprofit partners\ndoing important work to break down barriers to quality eye care worldwide. Recognizing the key link between vision and educational success, Alcon\nprograms screened more than 34,460 elementary school children in under-resourced markets, providing thousands of pairs of free glasses and medical\nreferrals, while training more than 350 vision screeners. Furthermore, the Alcon in Action initiative inspired thousands of Alcon associates to donate\ntheir own time to 119 partner organizations across the globe.\nBRILLIANT INNOVATION\nInnovation has always been a key driver of Alcon’s success. In 2022 alone, we invested more than $700 million on research and development to find\nnovel solutions for eye care. Our high levels of investment produced 55 new product approvals in major markets and allowed us to achieve 10 first-to-\nmarket launches. It also continued to fill a rich pipeline of more than 100 new products in development. Additionally, we embedded our Environmental\nSustainability Scorecard into the development process for new and existing products, including all early-stage products.\nBRILLIANT PLANET\nIn 2022, we continued to look for ways to advance environmental sustainability across our businesses to align with our goal of becoming 100% carbon\nneutral (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 2030. Some of the progress we highlight in the report includes decreasing energy intensity by 9% compared to our\n2019 baseline, completing 37 energy-saving projects that resulted in an estimated energy savings of approximately 71,619 gigajoules and achieving a\nlandfill diversion rate from manufacturing sites of approximately 95%. I would also note that our partnership with Plastic Bank across both the Surgical\nand Vision Care products helped remove the equivalent of more than 32 million plastic bottles this year.\nThese examples should give you a sense of the high level of engagement of more than 25,000 Alcon associates around the world and their determination\nto make social impact and sustainability one of the hallmarks of our leadership in eye care. With each innovation or milestone we achieve, we are\nemboldened to push even further. That’s a big part of what it means to us to See Brilliantly.\nThank you for your interest in Alcon.\nDavid J. Endicott\nCEO\n2"
