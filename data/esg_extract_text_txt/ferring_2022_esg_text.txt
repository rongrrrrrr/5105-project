Executive Chairman

Welcome from our President

4.18

With a global mean figure of 
4.18 for engagement, Ferring 
has earned an elite Gallup 
Exceptional Workplace Award, 
making a real difference to 
how employees experience 
work and life.

26

As part of our global  
benefits package, our 
employees benefit from 26 
weeks’ paid leave for both 
parents, ensuring equal 
opportunities and making no 
assumptions about parental 
roles and responsibilities.

280k

Ferring delivered over 280,000 
doses of Carbetocin to 12 
low and lower-middle income 
countries at an affordable and 
sustainable price, supporting 
the prevention of postpartum 
haemorrhage.

Ferring invested in an 
extensive data collection 
project, calculating 80% of 
global scope 1 and 2 carbon 
emissions to establish our 
2021 baseline.

80%

At the same time, we recognise that 
every organisation’s Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) 
performance is facing higher 
expectations and closer scrutiny from 
external stakeholders and society 
at large, not to mention its own 
employees. In light of this, we are 
constantly striving to take Ferring’s 
commitment to ESG to the next level.

I welcome the opportunity provided 
by this ESG Report to highlight the 
tremendous collection of data during 
2022, in addition to the progress 
we have made in areas such as 
employee engagement, access and 
affordability	of	treatments,	diversity,	
equity and inclusion.

I	am	confident	that	we	will	achieve 	
even more striking results in 2023, as 
we pursue our mission to build families 
and help people live better lives, and 
in so doing, to make the world a better 
place for all.

Lars Rebien Sørensen

Executive Chairman

Ferring has always maintained the 
highest ethical standards, as befits 
our mission to become the world-
leading, most trusted company 
in the field of reproductive 
medicine and maternal health, 
with a growing presence in 
gastroenterology and urology.

Our commitment to environmental and 
social responsibility, and to transparent 
and accountable governance, has been 
part of the company’s DNA ever since it 
was founded more than 70 years ago.

Good ESG practice begins at home, 
and in 2022 we introduced a global 
benefits	package	for	our	employees	
called Building Families at Ferring, 
including	generous	financial	benefits	
and a minimum of 26 weeks’ parental 
paid leave. Our high levels of employee 
engagement were recognised with a 
Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award, 
placing Ferring among an elite group of 
global organisations.

Efforts	to	reduce	the	company’s	
environmental impact also took a major 
step forward in 2022 with the launch 
of a data collection project to establish 
baseline levels of scope 1, 2 and 3 
greenhouse gas emissions. This will 
enable us to set carbon reduction targets 
and measure our progress in years to 
come. It is one of many measures which 
demonstrate our determination to pursue 
greater sustainability, and to exemplify the 
highest standards of corporate citizenship 
in every aspect of our activities.

of the human microbiome to treat 

Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection, 

while	Adstiladrin®	is	a	first-in-class	

gene	therapy	which	offers	a	novel 	

approach to treating a severe form of 

bladder cancer.

As this report explains, these 

successes were matched by 

significant	progress	in	the	field	of	

ESG. In 2022, we launched a series 

of far-reaching initiatives including 

an independent human rights risk 

assessment, a strategic plan for 

bioethics, and a quality risk register to 

ensure our medicines meet the highest 

standards	of	safety	and	efficacy.	

We also embarked on a programme 

to support families and children 

threatened by war in Ukraine.

One	of	our	flagship	ESG	programmes	

is	#ProjectFamily:	Safe	Birth	under	

which we supply Carbetocin Ferring, 

our heat-stable medicine for preventing 

postpartum haemorrhage, to women in 

low- and lower middle-income countries 

with a sustainable access price. In 

2022, we delivered more than 280,000 

doses to 12 countries, while Carbetocin 

Ferring	became	our	first	product	to	gain	

prequalification	status	from	the	World	

Health Organization, facilitating even 

wider access.

In many respects, 2022 was a year 
of unique achievements for Ferring.

We made a leap forward in innovation 
with the approval by the US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) of 
two ground-breaking therapies which 
could transform the future direction 
of the company. At the same time, we 
took further important steps towards 
embedding sustainability throughout 
the organisation.

From a business perspective, the 
highlight of 2022 was the approval of 
two therapies within a few weeks by 
the US FDA. The microbiota-based 
live biotherapeutic Rebyota™ could 
start to unlock the clinical potential

Ferring Philosophy

People come first at Ferring because:

Patients using our products and 
physicians prescribing them 
have	a	right	to	expect	that:

•	 the freedom to make mistakes 
and to admit to them without  
fear	of	retribution;

•	we will only make available  
those products in which we  
have	full	confidence;

•	we	will	offer	the	best	possible	

products at the most reasonable 
cost;

•	Ferring’s employees will always 
display courtesy and respect, 
and act professionally.

Ferring seeks the loyalty of these 
patients and physicians, and we are 
prepared to earn this loyalty anew 
every day.

Ferring expects that its employees 
will create value for the company 
and its stakeholders.

Ferring employees, at all levels, 
have a right to expect from the 
company	and	their	colleagues:

•	 respect, support and 
encouragement;	

•	 a work environment that is safe, 

stimulating	and	rewarding;

•	 that the highest standards of 
integrity will be maintained at 
all	times;

•	 that colleagues will never 
knowingly do anything to 
compromise their position as 
Ferring	employees;

•	 that all who represent Ferring 

will do so in ways that generate 
respect for the company and  
its employees.

Ferring	asks	its	employees	to:

•	always do what is right, proper 

and ethical, and encourage your 
colleagues	to	do	so;

•	speak out when you think that 
wrongs are being committed in 
Ferring’s	name;

•	be loyal, but only to that which 
is just, equitable, honourable 
and principled – and true to the 
Ferring philosophy.

No statement of principled 
behaviour can ever cover every 
situation, or deal with every 
contingency. It can only set the 
tone, making each individual 
responsible for applying that tone 
to his or her everyday practice. 
We	strive	to	set	that	tone	with	five	
simple	words:

People come 
first at Ferring.

Ferring Mission

Driven by its entrepreneurial 
spirit and enabled by a 
decentralised organisational 
setup, Ferring will harness its 
world-class competencies in 
science and business with 
other innovative technologies 
to create solutions for patients 
and doctors. 

Ferring will be the world-leading, 

most trusted healthcare company in 

reproductive medicine and maternal 

health, and a leader in specialty areas 

within gastroenterology and urology. 

Each of us at Ferring will contribute to 

providing innovative solutions to help 

people live better lives. We will devote 

significant	research	and	development	

investment to new therapeutics, 

life cycle management and next 

generation healthcare solutions.

As a privately-owned, specialist 

healthcare company that operates 

globally, Ferring will grow revenues 

at a rate that is 50% faster than 

the industry average. We will strive 

for	efficiencies	in	our	business	

and in our operations and create 

flexibility	to	invest	in	opportunities	

to build our future.

We are, and continue to be, part 

of a transparent and aligned 

company. We strive to best 

address the needs of patients, 

stakeholders and customers by 

collaborating across functions, 

experimenting and sharing our 

practices, and continuously 

learning. We are always guided  

by the Ferring Philosophy.

Ferring Ethics

To complement our Ferring 

Philosophy, our Code of Conduct 

instructs	us	in	specific	situations	and	

ensures that everyone complies with 

the law, industry codes, Ferring’s 

standards, policies, and internal 

rules. It provides clear guidelines of 

expected behaviour in the workplace 

and helps us to always act with 

integrity. In 2022, we launched a 

new curriculum which will deepen 

understanding	on	specific	topics	

within the Code of Conduct, 

starting with Respectful Workplace 

Behaviours & Virtual Harassment. 

We now have a fully automated 

system to facilitate and record the 

disclosure of Conflicts of Interest 

(“COI”) in a convenient and secure 

manner. All new employees and 

senior leaders are required to 

complete the COI form, and this 

will become a mandatory task for 

all existing employees.

We	continue	to	run	a	confidential	

AlertLine, operated by an 

independent third-party provider, 

for the reporting of known or 

suspected workplace violations of 

the Ferring Philosophy or Code of 

Conduct. The Ferring AlertLine, is 

available 24 hours a day, 7 days 

a week and in the language of all 

countries in which we operate.

Sustained financial 
performance is only 
possible if grounded in 
solid ESG behaviours. 
These behaviours align 
under our three focal 
pillars: Purpose, People, 
Planet which, in turn, 
continue to provide clear 
guidance and direction.

Introduction to

Our sustainability statement

Our sustainability vision is guided 
by the Ferring Philosophy, which 
means placing people at the heart 
of our business in a culture based 
on respect, integrity and doing 
the right thing. In our mission to 
become the world-leading, most 
trusted healthcare company in 
reproductive medicine and maternal 
health, and a leader in specialty 
areas within gastroenterology 
and urology, we are committed to 
conducting a responsible business 
and achieving sustainable growth 
built on our core values and strong 
ethical heritage. Guided by our 
commitment to the Sustainable 
Development Goals in pursuit of a 
better future for all, our approach is 
focused	on	three	pillars:	 
Purpose, People and Planet.

Purpose:  
ensuring responsible and ethical 
business governance to advance 
our mission to build families and 
help people live better lives.                                                                                                                                         

People:  
creating value for society 
by positively impacting the 
communities in which we 
operate, while safeguarding 
the health and wellbeing of our 
patients and employees.

Planet:  
protecting the environment by 
minimising our negative impacts 
to contribute to a better future. 

Our commitment will be driven by 
an integrated strategy with clear, 
impactful and measurable goals 
to ensure we can demonstrate 
progress to our stakeholders. We 
will	harness	our	scientific	expertise	
and research to continually improve 
the outlook for our patients. 

We will advance our sustainability 
vision to contribute to a fair and 
inclusive society and to protect 
the planet, creating a better future 
for the generations to come and 
strengthening our mission to  
build families and help people  
live better lives.

Materiality

A commitment to materiality 
is the principle of defining the 
environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) topics that 
matter most to our business 
in order to establish priorities, 
increase accountability and 
drive action.

Determining most  
relevant ESG topics

In 2021, Ferring engaged 
independent sustainability 
experts to carry out a double 
materiality assessment to 
identify ESG topics most 
relevant to the business.

Undertaking a materiality assessment 

provides an impartial and clear basis 

to guide priorities, develop achievable 

targets and establish reportable metrics 

to monitor progress. 

The concept of double materiality 

has been integrated into European 

and	Swiss	legislation	and	is	reflected	

in the forthcoming EU Corporate 

Sustainability Reporting Directive 

(CSRD).	When	this	comes	into	effect,	

many companies, including Ferring, 

will be required to incorporate double 

materiality into their ESG reporting.

The analysis involved  
four steps:

1

documents and policies

review of documents and 
policies available, both internally 
and publicly, to provide a 
deeper understanding of our 
initial approach to ESG

2

regulatory and disclosure 
requirements

mapping of current and 
anticipated regulatory and 
disclosure requirements, to 
provide a fuller understanding of 
our compliance obligations

3

peer benchmarking

4

stakeholder engagement

review of eight biopharma 
companies, to provide a 
clear picture of our position in 
comparison to peers and insight 
into industry trends and good 
practice ESG disclosures

interviews with key internal 
stakeholders from across 
the business to generate 
engagement and identify key 
areas of focus

  Key ESG material topics

The materiality assessment report highlighted the key material topics for Ferring and provided 
a solid foundation upon which to build an ESG strategy and reporting framework. 

1. ‘financial materiality’ 
examines how sustainability risks and 
opportunities may impact the company  
from a business viewpoint. 

A double materiality 
assessment takes two 
different perspectives  
into account

2. ‘impact materiality’ 
considers actual or potential 
significant impacts on people and the 
environment relating to the company’s 
operations and supply chain. 

Financial materiality  
(Impact on business)

Impact materiality 
(Impact on people and/or planet)

Ferring has a duty to respect human rights 
worldwide	within	its	sphere	of	influence	and	to	
ensure that human rights are not compromised by 
its business activities, including by its suppliers.

Conducting business in an ethical manner (e.g. 
with regard to clinical trials, animal testing and use 
of human biosamples) is critical to ensuring patient 
wellbeing	and	benefits.

Human rights infringements can have a serious 
impact on a company’s licence to operate. 
Additionally, the EU Human Rights Due Diligence 
Directive may include sanctions or penalties for 
non-compliance.

For pharmaceutical companies to maintain their 
social licence to operate, it is crucial to identify and 
address ethical issues, in particular those relating 
to the use of life science technologies for the 
discovery, development and production  
of products.

Product safety concerns, manufacturing defects 
or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks, 
can	lead	to	potential	financial	and	other	impacts	
for the company.  Addressing these areas protects 
shareholder value.

Strategic approaches to improve access to 
medicines (e.g. pricing frameworks that account 
for	differing	levels	of	economic	development	and	
healthcare need) can provide opportunities for 
growth, innovation and partnerships.

A	diverse	workforce	with	different	backgrounds	
and experiences brings greater engagement and 
creativity. This helps companies solve challenging 
problems and meet the needs of a range of 
patients and customers.

The pharmaceutical industry relies on highly skilled 
employees to conduct clinical trials, commercialise 
products and manage stakeholder relations. 
Businesses that can attract and retain employees 
are better positioned to protect and enhance 
company value.

Pharmaceutical companies play an important  
role	in	providing	affordable	access	to	medicines	
and treatments.

Greater diversity helps create more inclusive 
attitudes towards fertility and parenthood within 
society.	Employees	benefit	from	a	diverse,	
equitable, and inclusive work environment.

Developing a highly skilled and motivated 
workforce will make the company grow, and 
ultimately drive our success, leading to improved 
patient outcomes through innovations in R&D 
and products.

Pharmaceutical companies often operate energy-
intensive facilities in their operations and supply 
chain. Unless properly managed, this can lead  
to negative environmental impacts, including 
climate change.

17

Improved product quality and safety leads  
to better patient outcomes and builds trust  
within society.

Improving	energy	efficiency	and	switching	to	
renewable energy can decrease costs and reduce 
exposure to future environmental taxes.

Linking our ESG priorities to the  
UN’s Sustainable Development Goals

The United Nations Global 
Compact is the largest 
corporate sustainability initiative 
in the world, aimed at mobilising 
businesses and organisations to 
adopt sustainable and socially 
responsible policies and practices.

As a voluntary member since 2016, 
Ferring has adopted the UN Global 
Compact framework to align our 
strategies and operations with the 10 
principles in the areas of human rights, 
labour, environment, and anti-corruption.

The UN Global Compact encourages 
businesses to integrate the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
into their strategy, set targets, and 
report on progress. 

Launched in 2015, the 17 UN SDGs 
define	global	sustainable	development	
priorities and aspirations up to 2030, 
and	seek	to	mobilise	global	efforts	
around a common set of goals and 
targets. The SDGs explicitly call on 
businesses to apply their creativity 
and innovation to solving sustainable 
development challenges. 

The ambitious SDG targets cover a 
wide range of interconnected issues 
including poverty, hunger, health, 
education, gender equality, clean 
energy, responsible consumption, 
climate action, and more. If the goals 
are met, they will ensure the health, 
safety, and future of the planet for 
everyone living on it.

By aligning our actions with the SDGs, 
Ferring can contribute to sustainable 
development and address societal 
challenges while also creating value  
for our business.

causes, including haemorrhage and 
infections1. Many of these conditions 
can be prevented or treated given 

proper access to healthcare. Driven by 

a vision that no woman should die while 

giving birth, we developed a heat-stable 

version of carbetocin – our medicine for 

preventing postpartum haemorrhage 

(PPH), the leading direct cause of 

maternal deaths worldwide responsible 
for around 70,000 deaths a year2.

More than 90% of these deaths occur 

in low- and lower middle-income 

countries (L&LMICs) without reliable 

cold chain storage. We are committed 

to supplying Carbetocin Ferring at 

and MSD for Mothers. We also 

began the large-scale CHAMPION 

trial, which compared heat-stable 

carbetocin to oxytocin in the 

prevention of PPH following vaginal 

delivery. In 2018, results from the 

study were published in The New 
England Journal of Medicine4.

The WHO added heat-stable 

carbetocin to its PPH Prevention 
Guidelines in 20185, and in the 

following year to its Model Essential

Key data from 2022

As	we	are	finalising	the	collection	

of scope 1, 2 and 3 data, the 

graphs in this section only relate to 

the global manufacturing network. 

Greenhouse gas emissions

In 2022, absolute GHG emissions 

were reduced by 4% compared to 

2021. This was mainly due to an 

increased contribution of green energy 

from local power grids, resulting in 

lower emission factors. Relative GHG 

emissions were reduced by 8.3% 

compared to 2021.

isn’t always easy, it is 
reassuring to see how 
deeply everyone cares

Waste 

From 2021 to 2022, Ferring’s total 

waste production was reduced 

by 11%. In 2022, we recycled 

and recovered 79% of total waste 

volume, which was slightly lower 

than 2021 when 81% of waste was 

recycled. Both these changes were 

mainly due to reductions in waste 

from our site in Denmark.

Aggregate 
emissions

For scope 1, once the 
sources	are	identified,	
gather data on the 
amount of fuel consumed, 
distance travelled by 
company vehicles, or 
other relevant parameters 
for each emission source. 
For scope 2, collect 
data on the company’s 
electricity, heat, or steam 
consumption, often 
obtained from utility bills 
or energy providers.

Use appropriate 
emission factors to 
convert the activity 
data into GHG

to the type of fuel, 
process, energy

Sum up the

all scope 1 and 2 
sources to obtain 
the total scope 1

Eric Espinasse 

Chief Sustainability Officer

As the newly appointed Chief 

Sustainability	Officer,	I	would	like	to	pay	

tribute to the excellent foundation work 

delivered in recent years, providing an 

ideal platform to build and deliver even 

more results in the future.

We have now recruited colleagues 

for ESG dedicated positions and 

established a robust framework 

to implement our sustainability 

strategy across the organisation. 

This is quite unique for a mid-sized 

pharma company and will allow us 

to deliver on an ambitious agenda. 

To demonstrate our commitment, 

Ferring has included ESG among its 

key performance indicators (KPIs) to 

be tracked in the company’s global 

scorecard. All functions with ESG-

related priorities have done the same
