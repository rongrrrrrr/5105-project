Water Water is an essential component in the creation of our products.
As we expanded our contactlens manufacturing platform this year, we focused on maximizing water efficiency and increasingwater recycling and reuse.
Although our overall water intensity increased by 2% compared to our 2019 baseline, our year-over-year water intensity decreased by approximately 10%, even with a 5% increase in year-over-year absolute water consumption.To reduce our water consumption, we focus on water reuse and recycling.
In 2021, we implemented 17 water-saving projects at our sites, including a cooling tower optimization, reduced irrigationin landscaping and the installation of a rainwater reuse system.
These projects collectively savedapproximately 134 megaliters of water.
One project at our contact lens manufacturing facility in Batam, Indonesia, involved substituting the use of city water for gardening and toilet flushing withreverse osmosis and ultra-filtration reject water from water treatment systems.
As a result of thisproject, we expect to save approximately 2.1 megaliters (ML) of water annually at the site.
