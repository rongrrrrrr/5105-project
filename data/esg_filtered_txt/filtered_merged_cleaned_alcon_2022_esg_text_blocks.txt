Brilliance is a quality of sight, but it alsodescribes how we imagine and deliver this essential health outcome.
Enabling our progress is a system of values andshared cultural priorities that empower everyone at Alcon to make a Brilliant Impact.Throughout 2022, we strengthened the three pillars of our work that also describe our overarching objectives as a company: Brilliant Lives, Brilliant Innovation and Brilliant Planet.
Allow me to share a few examples.BRILLIANT LIVES We are committed to reducing the toll that low vision and preventable vision loss take around the world.
To accomplish this, we provide direct accessto eye care for under-resourced populations and work to increase the local capacity to diagnose vision problems and deliver care.
With an emphasis ontraining and education, through our Phaco Development program we trained 580 doctors who performed 1.6 million procedures around the world.
The Alcon Cares program provided $25 million in product and equipment donations, and our Alcon Foundation donated $4 million to nonprofit partnersdoing important work to break down barriers to quality eye care worldwide.
Recognizing the key link between vision and educational success, Alconprograms screened more than 34,460 elementary school children in under-resourced markets, providing thousands of pairs of free glasses and medicalreferrals, while training more than 350 vision screeners.
Furthermore, the Alcon in Action initiative inspired thousands of Alcon associates to donatetheir own time to 119 partner organizations across the globe.BRILLIANT INNOVATION Innovation has always been a key driver of Alcon's success.
In 2022 alone, we invested more than $700 million on research and development to findnovel solutions for eye care.
Additionally, we embedded our Environmental Sustainability Scorecard into the development process for new and existing products, including all early-stage products.BRILLIANT PLANET In 2022, we continued to look for ways to advance environmental sustainability across our businesses to align with our goal of becoming 100% carbonneutral (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 2030. Some of the progress we highlight in the report includes decreasing energy intensity by 9% compared to our 2019 baseline, completing 37 energy-saving projects that resulted in an estimated energy savings of approximately 71,619 gigajoules and achieving alandfill diversion rate from manufacturing sites of approximately 95%.
I would also note that our partnership with Plastic Bank across both the Surgicaland Vision Care products helped remove the equivalent of more than 32 million plastic bottles this year.These examples should give you a sense of the high level of engagement of more than 25,000 Alcon associates around the world and their determinationto make social impact and sustainability one of the hallmarks of our leadership in eye care.
With each innovation or milestone we achieve, we areemboldened to push even further.

This rubric helps the boards make assessments based on needs and objectives, organization financial health, program cost and value, impact,internal evaluation metrics and strategic alignment with Alcon's philanthropic goals.In 2022, Alcon Cares significantly increased its product and equipment donations for those in need and added the availability of new products, including Hydrus®, Simbrinza®, EYESUVIS® and INVELTYS®.
