# Analysis Process

## Step 1: Initial Text Analysis

First, carefully read and analyze the input text:

1. Identify the time period mentioned (focus on 2022 data)
2. Sumarise the main content of the sentence.
3. Based on the **All Categories and Tags**  scan for metrics objects
4. Locate numerical values and their associated units

## Step 2: Entity Recognition and Classification

For each identified element, determine its category:

### ESG Metrics Identification:

- Understand the meaning of each tag.
- Based on the analysis of inferring the proper tag(s) for the sentence.

### Value and Unit Analysis:

- Identify numerical values associated with 2022
- Based on the analysis results, obtain the proper value and unit of the corresponding metrics.
- Recognize measurement units and their components
- Check for combined value-unit words that need splitting


## Step 3: Word-Level Annotation

Process each word individually:

1. Split text into words
2. Handle special cases:
   - Hyphenated words as single words
   - Multi-word units
   - Punctuation marks as 'O'

## Step 4: Validation

Before finalizing, verify:

1. Tag sequence logic:
   - B- tags start new entities
   - I- tags follow appropriate B- tags
   - No overlapping annotations
2. Consistency check:
   - Year relevance (2022 focus)
   - Hierarchy compliance
   - Framework alignment
3. Format check:
   - output line by line

## Step 5: BIO Tag Assignment and Output

Apply the appropriate BIO tags:.

1. For ESG Metrics:
   - B-[Category]*[Topic]*[Metric] for the first word
   - I-[Category]*[Topic]*[Metric] for subsequent words
2. For Values:
   - B-VALUE for standalone numbers
   - I-VALUE for continuing parts
3. For Units:
   - B-UNIT for first unit word
   - I-UNIT for continuing unit parts

## Annotation Guidelines

1. **All tags must come from the given scheme; you cannot create your own.**

2. **Focus on 2022 Data**:
   - **Only annotate data explicitly associated with the year **2022**. Information from other years should be labeled as **O**.
   - **Explicit Association**: Numerical values and units should be annotated **only** if they are directly preceded by "fy2022" or clearly associated with the year 2022 in context.
   - **Examples**:
     - "fy2022: 6,280.00" → Annotate `6,280.00` as **B-VALUE**
     - "fy2021: 5,062.00" → Label `5,062.00` as **O**
     - "2022: 3433" → Annotate `3433` as **B-VALUE**

3. **Value and Unit Annotations**:

   - **Each pair of value and unit corresponds to a metric tag; find the most appropriate value and unit for labeling.**

   - **Numerical Values**: Annotate only numerical values with **B-VALUE** and **I-VALUE**.
     - Example: "5,000" → **B-VALUE**
   - **Units**: Annotate units separately with **B-UNIT** and **I-UNIT**.
     - Example: "MWh" → **B-UNIT**
   - **Combined words**: If a value and unit are combined (e.g., "5,000MWh"), split them into separate words before annotation.
     - Example: "5,000MWh" → "5,000" **B-VALUE**, "MWh" **B-UNIT**

4. **Frameworks and Disclosure Practices**:
   - Annotate recognized frameworks and their abbreviations using **B-GOV_ALF_AFD** and **I-GOV_ALF_AFD** tags.
   - Common frameworks include SDGs, TCFD, GRI, and SGX.
   - Example: "aligned with TCFD standards" → "TCFD" **B-GOV_ALF_AFD**, "standards" **I-GOV_ALF_AFD**

5. **Word-Level Annotation**:

   - Each word (word) in the sentence should be annotated individually.
   - Use spaces and punctuation marks to words appropriately.
   - Example:
     - "total energy consumption" → "total" **B-ENV_ENC_TEC**, "energy" **I-ENV_ENC_TEC**, "consumption" **I-ENV_ENC_TEC**
     - "Tom's" → **O**

6. **Proper wordization**:

   - **Hyphenated Words**: Treat hyphenated words as single words.
     - Example: "high-consequence" → "high-consequence" **B-SOC_OHS_HCI** (if applicable)
   - **Punctuation**: Ensure punctuation marks are labeled as **O**.
     - Example: "," → **O**, "." → **O**

7. **Hierarchy in Tagging**:

   - **Do not annotate the subcategories to a higher-level metric**.
   - **Example**:
     - Do not annotate "indirect energy consumption" , "electricity" or "fuel" the subset group to the **B-ENV_ENC_TEC** tag.
     - Do not annotate "male supervisors or managers" or "female supervisors or managers" to the higher level metrics like **B-SOC_GED_CEG_F**.

8. **Accurancy in Tagging:**

   - **Do not annotate the excluded content for the metric.**
   - **Example**:
     - Do not tag the male relative description with the female related tag like "male supervisors or managers" should not be tagged as "B-GOV_MAD_WMT".

9. **Consistency in Tagging**:

   - Maintain a consistent labeling pattern across similar entities.
   - Avoid overlapping or conflicting tags.

10. **Handling Multi-Word Units**:

    - Annotate each part of multi-word units with appropriate **B-UNIT** and **I-UNIT** tags.
    - Example: "metric tons of CO2" →
      - "metric" **B-UNIT**
      - "tons" **I-UNIT**
      - "of" **I-UNIT**
      - "CO2" **I-UNIT**

11. **Assurance Annotation:**

    - Annotate whether the sustainability report has undertaken:
      - (a) External independent assurance
      - (b) Internal assurance
      - (c) No assurance
    - These three options should be annotated accordingly.
    - Example: "this report is externally assured against the GRI standards for sustainability reporting" →
      - "externally" **B-GOV_ASS_ASR**
      - "assured" **I-GOV_ASS_ASR**
12. **Output Format:**

   - Use this format:

   ```
word tag
word1 tag1
word2 tag2
   ```

## Example Annotation

Let’s walk through an example sentence to demonstrate the BIO tagging process.

### Example Sentence

"In 2022, our total energy consumption reached 5,000 MWh, while scope 1 emissions were 2,500 metric tons of CO2e. The report is externally assured and follows GRI standards."

## Step 1: Initial Text Analysis

### Time Period Analysis

- Primary reference year: 2022
- All data points are explicitly associated with 2022

### ESG Terminology and Metrics Identified and inferred

1. Environmental Metrics:
   - Total energy consumption
   - Scope 1 emissions
2. Governance Metrics:
   - External assurance
   - GRI reporting framework

### Numerical Values and Units

1. Energy consumption: 5,000 MWh
2. Emissions: 2,500 metric tons of CO2e

## Step 2: Entity Recognition and Classification

### ESG Metrics Classification:

1. Total energy consumption:
   - Category: Environmental (ENV)
   - Topic: Energy Consumption (ENC)
   - Metric: Total Energy Consumption (TEC)
   - Tag: ENV_ENC_TEC

2. Scope 1 emissions:
   - Category: Environmental (ENV)
   - Topic: Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG)
   - Metric: Absolute Emissions (Scope 1) (AE1)
   - Tag: ENV_GHG_AE1

3. External assurance:
   - Category: Governance (GOV)
   - Topic: Assurance (ASS)
   - Metric: Assurance of Sustainability Report (ASR)
   - Tag: GOV_ASS_ASR

4. GRI standards:
   - Category: Governance (GOV)
   - Topic: Alignment with Frameworks (ALF)
   - Metric: ESG Frameworks and Disclosure Practices (AFD)
   - Tag: GOV_ALF_AFD

### Value and Unit Analysis:

1. Energy consumption value:
   - Value: 5,000
   - Unit: MWh

2. Emissions value:
   - Value: 2,500
   - Unit: metric tons of CO2e

## Step 3: Annotation Decisions and Rationale

1. **Time Period Focus**
   - All data is from 2022, so values are eligible for annotation
   - Year word "2022" itself is marked as O

2. **ESG Metrics**
   - "total energy consumption" tagged as ENV_ENC_TEC (Environmental category)
   - "scope 1 emissions" tagged as ENV_GHG_AE1 (Environmental category)
   - "externally assured" tagged as GOV_ASS_ASR (Governance category)
   - "GRI standards" tagged as GOV_ALF_AFD (Governance category)

3. **Values and Units**
   - Numerical values (5,000 and 2,500) tagged as B-VALUE
   - Units properly split and tagged (MWh as B-UNIT, "metric tons of CO2e" as B-UNIT/I-UNIT sequence)

4. **Special Considerations**
   - Multi-word units ("metric tons of CO2e") properly handled with B-UNIT and I-UNIT tags
   - Framework reference (GRI) properly tagged under Governance category
   - External assurance properly identified and tagged

## Step 4: Validation Checklist

✓ All tags follow proper B-I sequence
✓ No overlapping annotations
✓ All 2022 data properly captured
✓ Hierarchy compliance maintained
✓ Framework alignment properly tagged
✓ Units correctly split and tagged
✓ All punctuation marked as O
✓ Assurance status properly captured
