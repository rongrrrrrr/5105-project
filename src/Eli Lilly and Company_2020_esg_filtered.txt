our purpose is to make new medicines that make life better for people around the world.
while leveraging science and medicine to improve lives is by itself sustaining for humankind, we understand discovering, developing and making medicines alone is not enough.
we're investing in new ways to make medicines and care more accessible, affordable and useful for everyone who needs them.
to do this, we are reaching across industry and geographic boundaries to collaborate with all who share our goals of accelerating and improving access in the health-care system.
we further extend our impact by strengthening communities and making a positive difference in greater social issues that matter to our business, our employees and society.
mr. eli lilly 1947 lilly's covid-19 response exemplifies each of these elements, as we applied the full force of our scientific expertise to combat the pandemic and its devastating effects on our most vulnerable communities and health systems around the world.
we moved quickly to protect the well-being of our workforce, led the response to enormous testing deficits in our home state and collaborated across public and private sectors to discover new covid-19 antibodies in record time - all while maintaining a steady supply of medicines for about 45 million people who rely on us.
although we aren'tonnes done battling covid-19, we are changed by this challenge.
more than ever, we see the positive impact we can have to improve the human condition through new medicine coupled with responsible and sustainable actions, to ensure more people benefit and our work fits into the broader challenges the world faces.
key to this effort is prioritizing environmental, social and governance esg goals and investing in resources to expand our progress.
sustainability at lilly for lilly, sustainability starts with our purpose and is guided by our long-standing values of integrity, excellence and respect for people.
sustainability has always been central to lilly, and we dedicate ourselves to ensuring our sustainability efforts help address important issues for our business, our employees and society.
we'll use the sustainability accounting standards board sasb and the task force on climate-related financial disclosures tcfd frameworks and continue to report our progress on the united nations sustainable development goals.
to provide esg governance and oversight, we have clear lines of responsibility from lilly's board of directors and executive committee to an esg governance committee that is responsible for operationalizing our strategy.
human capital management is foundational whatever we accomplish is made possible by our talented, dedicated people.
fulfilling our purpose requires highly skilled employees to be fully engaged in solving the world's toughest health challenges.
we provide support for our global workforce through wide-ranging opportunities for training, leadership development and well-being.
engaging our communities and serving our patients we're taking action to improve equity more broadly as well, launching a racial justice initiative to augment the work we're doing both within lilly and in our communities.
we're expanding diversity in our clinical trials, increasing employment opportunities and investing in new health care initiatives for marginalized communities.
in early 2021, we also announced a $30 million investment in the unseen capital health fund to support founders and innovators who are enhancing health access in historically marginalized communities across the u.s. globally, lilly partners to improve access to our medicines and tackle complex health challenges.
we aim to improve access to quality health care for 30 million people living in limited-resource settings annually by 2030. in our battle against covid-19, we've collaborated with the gates foundation to supply our treatment antibodies to low- and middle-income countries.
we use philanthropy and shared-value approaches to improve health systems and concentrate on diseases where we have deep technical expertise, such as our collaboration with life for a child that will expand access to care for approximately 150,000 youth with diabetes across 65 countries.
we've also made a $100 million commitment to the pharma-led amr action fund, the world's largest public-private partnership addressing the global health threat of antibiotic-resistant infections.
in the u.s., as we work to advance discussions to address structural factors that increase costs to patients, we continue to partner with the nonprofit and public sectors to help millions of people gain access to lilly medicines.
protecting the planet because making medicines requires the use of valuable resources, including energy, water and raw materials, we work to reduce our environmental footprint with a focus on addressing climate change, waste and water security.
we believe that maintaining a safe operation for our workers and communities is our first responsibility - no one should get hurt at work or in our communities because of our work.
we've set ambitious 2030 environmental goals.
for climate, we plan to secure 100% of our purchased electricity from renewable sources, make our own operations carbon neutral and enhance tracking and reporting of our full value-chain emissions.
for waste, our goals are to send zero waste to landfills from our routine operations, to repurpose 100% of plastic waste for beneficial use - with at least 90% recycled or reused and to integrate sustainability focused design principles into product and packaging design processes.
finally, for water, we plan to establish and conform to water management plans for lilly sites in water-stressed areas, and continue to have 100% of lilly sites meet predicted no-effect concentrations for pharmaceuticals in the environment.
esg is how we operate more important than setting ambitious goals is achieving them.
we review progress on these goals as a full executive committee quarterly and the board annually.
when challenges arise, we expect our team to work to overcome them and to treat esg objectives no differently than other vital business challenges.
together with the support of our stakeholders, the contributions of our lilly colleagues and our partners across the health-care system, we believe we can fulfill the charge of eli lilly, our company's founder: "take what you find here and make it better and better." david a. ricks chairman and ceo my signature above affirms our company's ongoing commitment and our intent to support and advance the united nations global compact's ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption, in addition to the united nations sustainable development goals.
we aim to strike a balance between access and affordability for patients while sustaining investments in life-changing treatments for some of today's most serious diseases.
the way that medicines are paid for in the current health-care system may seem confusing.
anyone using lilly insulin - regardless of their insurance status - is now eligible to buy their monthly prescription for $35.
we disclose relevant information and progress around the management of our esg priorities and aim to stay up to date with relevant sustainability and social impact reporting frameworks, and standards that best meet the needs of our stakeholders.
